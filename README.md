### Stacky 


I made this simple and fun quiz game with **React.js** to help people decide which development role best fits their personality.

### How it works ?

You answer a series of personality-style questions about your interests and coding preferences. Each answer gives points toward Frontend, Backend, or Fullstack. At the end, the quiz totals your score and reveals which developer role best matches your personality.



### Feature Updates

- Implement entire app with Redux.
- Publish the results via Social share.
- Add sound effects and animations.
